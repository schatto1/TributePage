# A Tribute to Hayao Miyazaki

This is a tribute page dedicated to Hayao Miyazaki, created as one of the coding challenges for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

As per the requirements, this page was first coded in CodePen, before I realized that I should have a local copy where I can track versions. 

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/schatto1/pen/WMjJpm.
